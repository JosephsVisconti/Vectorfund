            <h3>We invest at the point where talent meets intent</h3>
            <p>
              Our focus is not on polished decks or pedigree, but on signal: technical depth,
              speed of execution, and clarity of purpose. We look for builders who ship code,
              not presentations.

            <h3>We partner at the moment of decision</h3>
            <p>
              When exceptional builders decide to turn code into a company, we provide early conviction
              capital and structural guidance. Formation, capitalization, narrative—we help founders
              establish strong foundations while maintaining ownership and velocity.

            <h3>We align through equity, not fees</h3>
            <p>
              Our incentives are fully aligned with founders. We don't charge for legal structure,
              cap table design, or strategic support. Success is measured by durable growth
              and eventual liquidity—acquisition, secondary sales, or public markets.

          <div className="philosophy-principle">
            <h3>We value long-term institutional impact</h3>
            <p>
              We're building relationships that span decades, not quarters. The best companies
              take time to mature. We're patient capital with conviction in exceptional people.
